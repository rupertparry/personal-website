# Hi, I'm Rupert.

I'm a technologist, designer, and musician from Sydney. I'm interested in emerging technologies and their impact on human culture. I formerly worked at Google's Creative Lab.

## What I'm doing

- Building secret speculative projects with Google and Heyday *(shh!)*
- Leading an investigation on the future of AI in the music industry
- Helping out with an Indigenous AI incubator hosted by Old Ways New

**I'm also working freelance!** You can hire me to prototype that cool new thing you want to make, or build that website. Maybe we can explore a big thorny question about technology, where it's headed, and what you're going to do about it <i>(workshops, ideation, prototypes & speculative design)</i>.

## Some past projects


<ul class="projects-list">
<li>

**I built a series of [AI tools for writers](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/aiwriting) and [musicians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbKsRJ5MsnA) in collaboration with Google and Uncanny Valley.** We explored how AI could be a creative collaboration tool in music and language. It spawned a series of short stories featured in the [Digital Writers Festival](https://2019.digitalwritersfestival.com/event/creativity-inside-the-machine/), and was presented at the [2020 ARIA Masterclass](https://www.aria.com.au/awards/news/aria-masterclass-machine-learning-ai-music).

</li>
<li>

**[Semi-Conductor](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/semi-conductor) is an experiment in interfaces.** What if you could change the feel and tempo of digital music without an interface at all, just by waving your arms like aconductor? It's been [featured in the MIM Museum in Chile](https://www.futuro360.com/videos/inteligencia-artificial-ninos-ninas-mim_20190813/) and experienced by over 200,000 people worldwide. Plus, it's [open source](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/semi-conductor).

</li>
<li>

**[Sounds In Space](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/sounds-in-space) is a toolkit for developing location-based audio AR experiences.** E.g. you can walk around a room with your phone, drop virtual instruments in space, then walk around while a band "plays" in the room with you. The tech has been used by [dance troupes in Harlem](https://heidilatskydance.org/displayed) and led to a [public art exhibition at MUMA](https://vimeo.com/393792407). It's freely available [here](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/sounds-in-space).

</li>
</ul>

I've also built handsome websites, a charity fintech startup, AI-powered chatbots & virtual assistants, a tattoo that turns into an augmented-reality dinosaaur, electronic art installations, and a tiny website that tells you where to get a [damn cheap oyster](http://oyster.cheap).
